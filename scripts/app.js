Brief overview
-Goal is to evolve groot through some stages 
-Grow seedling Groot by watering him consistently for a specific amount of time.
-After specific time groot will sprout to baby groot 
-if groot doesn't get watered he will die
-after groot sprouts into baby groot, he needs to be cared for a little more 
-feed (water/fertilizer) 
-attention (spend time?)
-sleep (for rest)

-When user clicks start, the first meter appears, and seedling needs to be watered
-When user clicks the start (button) at the top of the body's page, the meter will begin
-to water the seedling press a button/icon that waters the seedling
-water about 30s, if button is nt pressed when meter goes down, the game is over
-if consisitently watered seedling changes into a baby groot
-after change, 3 other similar meters pop up 
- along with meters 3 other buttons pop up
-all 3 meters are the same but have about 20s or 15s to be press,
- if one meter goes down game over, groot dies,
-all buttons have to be managed consistently for the game to keep going
-goal is just to keep groot alive as long as possible
