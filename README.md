## Welcome to Grootagotchi

- What we have here is a Tamagotchi game, The Pet is named "Groot".
Right now your Groot is still a seedling so we need to make grow it.
Water your Groot daily to see it grow! 
Your goal is to care for your Groot daily and not it die.

- Within a timeframe of consistently caring for your Groot will evolve into Baby Groot! etc.
If we don't tend to your Groot, it will eventually die.
Your Groot needs food, attention, and sleep!

- To see your Groot morph through stages, carefully manage him by consistently giving him food, attention, and sleep!
