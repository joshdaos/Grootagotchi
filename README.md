 GROOTAGOTCHI PROJECT ZERO - Josh Daos

## Welcome to Grootagotchi

1. What we have here is a Tamagotchi game, The Pet is named "Grootagotchi".
Right now he is still a seedling so we need to make him grow.
Water him daily to see him grow! 
Your goal is to gorw him to baby Groot and not let him die.

2. Within a timeframe of consistently watering him he'll evolve into baby Grootgotchi!
If we don't tend to him he'll eventually die from lack of hunger.

3. Once he is sprouted he'll become baby groot!
Now that he is sprouted he'll need more than just water..
He needs food, love, and sleep!
