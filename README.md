 GROOTAGOTCHI PROJECT ZERO - Josh Daos

## Welcome to Grootagotchi

- What we have here is a Tamagotchi game, The Pet is named "Groot".
Right now he is still a seedling so we need to make him grow.
Water him daily to see him grow! 
Your goal is to gorw him to baby Groot and not let him die.

- Within a timeframe of consistently watering him he'll evolve into Baby Groot!
If we don't tend to him he'll eventually die from lack of hunger.

- Once he is sprouted he'll become baby groot!
Now that he is sprouted he'll need more than just water..
He needs food, attention, and sleep!

- Carefully manage him by consistently giving him food, attention, and sleep!


# Game Logic:
- Type in input your groot pet's name
- Grow button starts the game also submits your user name
- Water button increases hunger bar
- Play button increases entertained bar
- Sleep button increases rest bar
